            <h1>The Airbnb's Of Melbourne</h1>
            <p>
                Over the years Melbourne has consistently been ranked as the world's most liveable city. 
                This is no coincidence. Being named the sports capital of Australia, hosting the 
                AFL Grand Final, Australian Open, The Boxing Day Test, and upcoming  T20I World-Cup final. 
                It is the dream location for every sports lover. Not to mention the multiple scenic beaches 
                around Melbounrne, the modern infastrucutre and easy access public transport around 
                Melbounrne which make it the ideal location for tourists of all backgrounds. Therefore, 
                the demand for Airbnb's has been increasing to accomodate for tourists who do not always 
                want to stay in hotels.
                <br></br>
                The following visualisation provides an overview of the information about Melbourne Airbnb's, 
                modelled from data obtained at <b><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylerx/melbourne-airbnb-open-data?select=cleansed_listings_dec18.csv">Kaggle</a></b>.
                The visualisations explore the density, price and average size of accomodations across 
                Melbourne, to enable locals and tourists to make well informed decisions while booking 
                an AirBnB.

        <div class = "pure-u-1-2">
                <h2>The Density of Airbnb's Across Melbourne</h2>
                <p id = "left-alligned">
                    The dot density map displays the location of Airbnb's around <br>Melbourne. The different
                    colours signify the thirty different cities around <br>Melbourne. <i>By hovering over 
                    any single data point (Airbnb residence)<br> the city of each Airbnb can be identified. 
                    Furthermore, the<br> legend can be used as a filter. </i>
                    <br><br>
                    The map signifies that the central Melbourne area is Airbnb <br>dense, and as we withdraw
                    from central Melbourne we <br>observe that the density of Airbnbs also decreases. However,
                    this <br>trend is only apparent in cities to the East of Central Melbourne.<br> The coastline 
                    throughout Melbourne is still very dense<br> and a highly sought Airbnb destination.

        <div class = "pure-u-1-2">
            <h2>Average Price Per City and Land Size</h2>
            <p id = "left-alligned">
                <b><span class = 'red'>Yarra Ranges</span></b> 
                is the most expensive city within Melbourne for <br> travellers, with an average 
                price of <b><span class = 'red'>$246</span></b>. On the other end of <br> the spectrum we 
                observe that the city of <b><span class = 'green'>Brimbank</span></b> has the <br> lowest
                average price for AirBnBs is <b><span class = 'green'>$79</span></b>. 
                <br><br>
                East and South East Melbounre cities have <b><span class = 'red'>higher average 
                prices</span></b> <br> per AirBnb. From the density visualisation we find that the East<br>
                and South East Melbounre cities are also less compact with<br>respect to centeral Melbourne. 
                This could be an indication that<br>the average price is skewed by the soaring prices of 
                a select<br>few AirBnBs within East and South East Melbounre. In contrast<br>this signifies 
                that the average price of highly dense areas are <br> less likely to be skewed.

            <h2>Average Price Per City and Accomodation Sizes</h2>
            <p>
                Both visualisations provide an overview of the average prices for each city within Melbourne.
                Where the bar chart allows for filtering and clear identification of cities, the choropleth 
                map enables us to make an observation about the average prices compared to the land area and 
                the density of air-bnb's from "The Density of Airbnb's Across Melbourne" visualisation.
                <br><br>
                - The difference between density and the price.<br><br>
                - Land Area vs Price<br><br>
                - Perhaps create a visual of distance from CBD.<br><br>
                - Also creating chropleth map on average number of rooms in each city.<br><br>
