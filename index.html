            <h1>The Airbnb's Of Melbourne</h1>
            <p>
                Over the years Melbourne has consistently been ranked as the world's most liveable city. 
                This is no coincidence. Being named the sports capital of Australia, hosting the 
                AFL Grand Final, Australian Open, The Boxing Day Test, and upcoming  T20I World-Cup final. 
                It is the dream location for every sports lover. Not to mention the multiple scenic beaches 
                around Melbounrne, the modern infastrucutre and easy access public transport around 
                Melbounrne which make it the ideal location for tourists of all backgrounds. Therefore, 
                the demand for Airbnb's has been increasing to accomodate for tourists who do not always 
                want to stay in hotels.
                <br></br>
                The following visualisation provides an overview of the information about Melbourne Airbnb's, 
                modelled from data obtained at <b><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tylerx/melbourne-airbnb-open-data?select=cleansed_listings_dec18.csv">Kaggle</a></b>.
                The visualisations explore the density, price and average size of accomodations across 
                Melbourne, to enable locals and tourists to make well informed decisions while booking 
                an AirBnB.

        <div class = "pure-u-1-2">
                <h2>The Density of Airbnb's Across Melbourne</h2>
                <p id = "left-alligned">
                    The dot density map displays the location of Airbnb's around Melbourne. The different
                    colours signify the thirty different cities around Melbourne. <i>By hovering over 
                    any single data point (Airbnb residence) the city of each Airbnb can be identified. 
                    Furthermore, the legend can be used as a filter. </i>
                    <br><br>
                    The map signifies that the central Melbounre area is Airbnb dense, and as we withdraw
                    from centeral Melbourne we observe that the density of Airbnb's also decreases. However,
                    this trend is only apprent for cities to the East of Centeral Melbourne. The coastline 
                    throughout Melbourne is still very dense and a highly sought out Airbnb destination.

            <p>
                Both visualisations provide an overview of the average prices for each city within Melbourne.
                Where the bar chart allows for filtering and clear identification of cities, the choropleth 
                map enables us to make an observation about the average prices compared to the land area and 
                the density of air-bnb's from "The Density of Airbnb's Across Melbourne" visualisation.
                <br><br>
                - The difference between density and the price.<br><br>
                - Land Area vs Price<br><br>
                - Perhaps create a visual of distance from CBD.<br><br>
                - Also creating chropleth map on average number of rooms in each city.<br><br>
